/**
 * GoogleClient — minimal Google Calendar + Tasks reader for the Taskpoint
 * Reminders feature.
 *
 * Uses the OAuth2 refresh-token flow (Device Authorization Flow set up once on a
 * PC; see firmware/FIRMWARE_SETUP.md). Credentials live on the SD card at
 * /.crosspoint/google_creds.json and are loaded on every sync.
 *
 * syncAll() performs the full sequence (WiFi connect -> NTP -> token refresh ->
 * Calendar GET -> Tasks GET -> WiFi teardown) and fills `out`. HTTPS is verified
 * against the firmware's bundled CA roots via esp_crt_bundle_attach (the same
 * transport HttpDownloader uses), so no per-cert maintenance is required.
